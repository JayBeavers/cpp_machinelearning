# cpp_machinelearning

This repository is a reimplementation of the Andrew Ng machine learning homework, as written in C++ using the Armadillo matrix library
and the gnuplot-iostream plotting library.  These libraries provide the closest analog I could find to the Octave/Gnuplot environment
used in the class.

I'm motivated to both figure out the comparative difficulty of coding ML algorithms in cross platform C++ compared to Octave and as a
learning effort to reenforce the class information by restating the work in a different context.
